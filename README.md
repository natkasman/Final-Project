# Shadow Stamp

I want to create an interactive experience that resembles an ink stamp, but with one's body shape.


## Summary 

Shadow Stamp is an interactive experience that reimagines how we behave in public spaces; integrating play into public spaces. 
Passers-by will be detected, and their bodies will be represented by different colors. If they stay in a position for longer
than 3 seconds, their bodies and colors, will be stamped onto the projection. The colors of the stamped shadows will be darker
than the ones that are not; to differentiate the two. 

The main goal is to have people stop, and instead of being guarded in their environment, feel comfortable and playful,
and maybe even play with other strangers.


## Component Parts

Hardware: Camera

Software: p5.js / ml5.js


## Challenges

1. Timer/Capture
I foresee needing a timer and capture state (like a self-timer camera), but these are things I've never touched or done
before. If it's a high-traffic area, how does it detect which person to capture? Or can it capture both people?  

2. When to reset/show
When the body shapes are stamped, I wonder what I need to ensure they stay projected, and only disappear (or reset),
after the projection has more than 10 body shapes.


## Timeline

Week 1: Write proposal. Get Posenet working â€” 1. Detect bodies. 2. Attach shapes on bodies.

Week 2: Build timer/capture aspect on to the experience.

Week 3: Make sure canvas resets after 10 stamps.

Week 4: Present
